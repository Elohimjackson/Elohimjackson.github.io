[Enhancement One Software design/engineering](https://github.com/Elohimjackson/Elohimjackson.github.io/blob/main/CS300%20Project2%20Enhancedversion.cpp)

1.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
This artifact is a mobile application for a loan service. The loan service deals with 3rd world countries and gives them the opportunity to still be able to get out a business loan. These places include, India, Africa, etc. just to name a few. This was created in my CS319 course here at Southern New Hampshire University and was created 8/8/2022 for my software design project. 
2.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? 
I selected this artifact to be included into my portfolio because I believe that it thoroughly demonstrates my ability in software design. This obviously is a prototype version of what the artifact would be, but this is what would be presented to the designers and from there they would bring it to life. I would say the realism of the design showcases my skills. From having an actual browser bar at the top, a keyboard, and relevant text based on the purpose of the application. The artifact was improved by making it more realistic to what an actual application would look like. Not only that but modifying the text to go along with the loaning service and the different buttons that they would use. 
3.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? 
Yes I did meet the goals I set out to from the previous plan. I believe that I was able to enhance the application and make the prototype look real and shows the different options that the application should have. I do not have any updated regarding the outcomes. Based on the work I was able to visibly enhance the UI to better fit the customers needs of the application. 
4.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
What I was able to learn and realize was how fun it is creating essentially prototypes. It’s something that isn’t hard at all to do and something that can be as creative as the person creating it. I learned different techniques to use and implement into this artifact. There weren’t any challenges that I faced. I knew what I needed to do and I just followed my plan through and the outcome was as expected.
