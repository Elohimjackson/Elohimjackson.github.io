# Artifacts:

# *1. Enhancement One Software Design/ Engineering*


**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**

This artifact is a mobile application for a loan service. The loan service deals with 3rd world countries and gives them the opportunity to still be able to get out a business loan. These places include, India, Africa, etc. just to name a few. This was created in my CS319 course here at Southern New Hampshire University and was created 8/8/2022 for my software design project.

**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?**

I selected this artifact to be included into my portfolio because I believe that it thoroughly demonstrates my ability in software design. This obviously is a prototype version of what the artifact would be, but this is what would be presented to the designers and from there they would bring it to life. I would say the realism of the design showcases my skills. From having an actual browser bar at the top, a keyboard, and relevant text based on the purpose of the application. The artifact was improved by making it more realistic to what an actual application would look like. Not only that but modifying the text to go along with the loaning service and the different buttons that they would use. 

**Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?**

Yes I did meet the goals I set out to from the previous plan. I believe that I was able to enhance the application and make the prototype look real and shows the different options that the application should have. I do not have any updated regarding the outcomes. Based on the work I was able to visibly enhance the UI to better fit the customers needs of the application.

**Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**

What I was able to learn and realize was how fun it is creating essentially prototypes. It’s something that isn’t hard at all to do and something that can be as creative as the person creating it. I learned different techniques to use and implement into this artifact. There weren’t any challenges that I faced. I knew what I needed to do and I just followed my plan through and the outcome was as expected.

# *2. Algorithms and data structure*

**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**

The artifact used comes from a course from SNHU the course was CS300 data structures and algorithms. In this project I had to use a data structure and algorithm that would allow students to find their classes fast and effective using their course name, number, and prerequisites. This artifact was created and completed on 10/26/2022.

**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?**

I added this artifact into the portfolio because it shows that I have used and know how to use data structures and algorithms. The specific elements from this project that showcase my skill is solving a real-world problem. Many times, when people look up information there is a hundred different things that can pop up for what they searched. With the binary search tree algorithm, it makes it easy for people to find exactly what they want. In this case for the students to find their courses. I improved this artifact by doing what I said I was going to do. I improved it by giving the binary search tree and additional feature and that being postOrder. In the project I just inOrder so it would just read it out in order. Adding post order just future showcases my skills because it shows I know how to use traversal. In postOrder it will go from the left side of the tree first then will go into the right side of the binary tree. This addition just added another feature. 

**Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?**

Yes I did. I met the objectives that I set out to meet from module one. I mentioned adding postOrder into the project to add more complexity to it and to also showcase my skills and knowledge in binary search trees. The outcomes from this will showcase my skills with binary search trees. The project only had one traversal used previously and now as inOrder and postOrder. The outcomes will allow for an easier and more efficient search engine for the students when they are trying to look for their courses.

**Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**

My reflection on the enhancements is that I had a good understanding of binary search trees. With this information I knew I would be able to successfully add another traversal into the project that only had inOrder. I added postOrder which goes from the left side of the tree then the right. It was easy for me to add. What I learned was just adding a small feature to something like that can make a huge difference not only that, but it will allow for a faster search engine. I didn’t face any challenges with adding another traversal it took more time actually finding the project. Because I haven’t used binary search trees since that course I just read up on a few things and it came back to me. 

The outcomes that I achieved were employing strategies for building a collaborative environment. I did this by publishing my code and not only that but having inline comments so that other know exactly what the code does and what its there for. It would allow for something to easily pick it up and/or add my algorithm to one of their projects. I achieved designing, developing, and delivering communications thought this milestone in a way a non-technical person would still understand. I designed a computer solution with the algorithm that was able to solve real world problems. I used techniques, skills, and tools for the purpose of enhancing this artifact, and last I was able to develop a security mindset when thinking about how to securely add the algorithm into the pre-existing code.

# *3. Databases*

**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**

The artifact that I chose for the database comes from another course from SNHU. In this project I was to create a database of rescue animals that would be used in different types of rescues. The different types were for water, mountain/wilderness, and disaster rescue and individual tracking. This project was created early this year in 2023 for my database course. 

**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?**

I selected this artifact because it shows a lot about my skills using databases. Not only did I use databases within the project, but I also was able to incorporate a histogram, and a map that would show where there rescue animals are located. I feel like the whole artifact showcases my skills. The skills specifically that I displayed was creating a database that the teams could use to pick their animals for a specific disaster. I was also able to showcase my skills in incorporating different charts and maps. The artifact was improved by allow the users of the database to be able to delete components from the database. I did this because if a animal is already in use or something happens to the animal in the field it needs to be deleted from the database. This addition will allow that to be a smooth and easy process. 

**Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?**

Yes I met the course objectives that I planned in module one. I enhanced the database exactly how I said I would. In this I was able to meet the course objectives. I was able to employ strategies for building a collaborative environment by using industry standard in line comments. This will allow for someone to see my code and know exactly what it will do and how it is used. I designed, developed, and delivered professional oral and written communications that when read will be able to be read by non-technical people that they will be able to understand. In this enhancement I was able to design a solution that would work in the real world for this particular type of database. Allowing the database owner to make these changes will enhance the database tremendously. I used industry techniques, skills, and tools in this project to meet the projects objectives and showcase my abilities in using databases. I kept a security mindset while developing this database by using industry standard techniques. 

**Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**

Enhancing this artifact what I was able to learn while improving the database was how important a database is to a company and that with these little tweaks to the database it can take it to another level and allow for easy deletion of animals that are unavailable or not in the database anymore. I did not face any real difficulties with this artifact just needed a reprogram on databases and how I would be able to do this only took a bit of research.
